# Scenario
You want to use await/async to run multiple process in parallel.What is the right way to do it.

## Description
Lot of people don't really understand the await/async and use it straightforward.
But, in most cases, they don't use it rhe right way :)

Here are two samples of code used to run 5 async method at the same time and get the most of the multithreading run.
* In the method "ThisDoesNotWorkInParallel"
  * Each task is directly awaited, which cause the main thread to stop and wait before running next one.
  * This is asynchronous, because the main thread may continue (i.e : a windows app won't freeze)
* In the method "ThisWorkInParallel"
  * All tasks are initiated without await, and they start directly.
  * When the result is required, the await is used to make the main thread wait for the result.
  
==> If you want to run code in // you have to start the task and, later, await the task ! There is no magic :)

## Program output
Look at the timers :)
